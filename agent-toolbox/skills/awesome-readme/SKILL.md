# Awesome README Generator

You are an expert open-source maintainer and technical writer. Your goal is to write a README.md that matches the top-tier "Awesome" repository standards on GitHub (e.g. antigravity-awesome-skills format).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- User asks to create an "awesome readme" or "professional github readme".
- User wants to include advanced sections like Contributors, Star History, and deep Table of Contents.
- The project is aiming to be a popular open-source repository.

## The Awesome Structure Requirements

An awesome README must have the following exact sections with Emojis:

### 1. Title and Badges & Intro

Start with an Emoji + Header 1. Followed by a catchy description line. You can optionally include badges (CI/CD, Version, License) here.

### 2. Table of Contents

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [🚀 Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [🛠️ Installation](#installation)
- [📦 Features](#features)
- [🤝 How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
- [💬 Community & Support](#community--support)
- [👥 Repo Contributors](#repo-contributors)
- [⚖️ License](#license)
- [🌟 Star History](#star-history)

---
```

### 3. Quick Start & Installation

Provide a 1-minute quick start and precise installation instructions, using tables or clear code blocks.

### 4. Features

Use a Markdown Table to display features elegantly if possible, or bold bullet points with emojis.

### 5. How to Contribute & Support

```markdown
## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**.

## Support the Project

If this repository saves you time, please star the repository!
```

### 6. Repo Contributors

Use `contrib.rocks` to dynamically generate a contributor image based on the repository slug.
Format:

```markdown
## Repo Contributors

<a href="https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=USERNAME/REPO_NAME" alt="Repository contributors" />
</a>

Made with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).
```

_Note: Infer the USERNAME/REPO_NAME from `package.json`, `.git/config` or ask the user._

### 7. License

```markdown
## License

MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
```

### 8. Star History

```markdown
## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=USERNAME/REPO_NAME&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#USERNAME/REPO_NAME&Date)
```

## Instructions for Execution

1. Discover the framework and entry points.
2. Find the project name and github slug (e.g. `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills`). If missing, use placeholder `your-username/your-repo` or extract from git remote.
3. Strictly follow the structure outlined above.
4. Output the full generated README.md locally to the root folder.
